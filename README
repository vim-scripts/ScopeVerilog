Veratags is a cool utility(available at http://webpages.charter.net/jeffkoehler/jeffkoehler_com/tools/veratags/veratags.html)
It can create an ascii hierachy of ur design and creates tag for the verilog files as well.
Use this script(hierarchy.vim) to know the current scope (based on where ur cursor is) in the 
info.txt file

You may want set ur status line to
set statusline=%{Verilog_get_hierarchy()}

Please update the file as per ur convenience, I am new to vim programming so might have done a buggy coding
